# RNA-Sequencing Analysis Normalization Techniques

By Daniella Vo, Nidhi Bangari, Priya Jindal

## Introduction

RNA-sequencing is used to determine the gene expression levels, which allows 
researchers to identify differentially expressed genes, discover new RNA isoforms,
and genomic mutations. The input for RNA-seq analysis is raw reads, and the output is differentially expressed genes, which are genes that are expressed differently for different cells. The pipeline for RNA-seq analysis is shown below:
