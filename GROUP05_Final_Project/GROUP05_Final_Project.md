## Background <a name="1"></a>
Mutational Signatures are characteristic combinations of mutation types, which arise from specific mutational processes. These are often associated with cancer and cancer profiling. We'll first discuss how cancer arises from somatic mutations, and then get into the details of how mutational signatures were discovered, the various types, and how they are extracted. We'll then discuss the relevance of mutational signatures as it relates to sequencing analysis in cancer research and in the clinical setting.

## Cancer <a name="2"></a>
Cancer is the term for the collection of diseases resulting from abnormal cell division. Tumors caused by cancer divide without control and invade nearby cells and tissues (1). All cancer originates from somatic mutations (2). Cancer is caused by multiple DNA alterations in the cell, although most mutations in genomes do not bear a strong impact on cancer selection (2).

Different types of cancer arise depending on the different combinations of mutations that and the tissue type that these mutations occur in. Different somatic mutational processes generate unique combinations of mutations in cancers called mutational signatures. Some signatures correlate with the age of the patient, defects in DNA maintenance or mutagenic exposures; but many signatures have other unknown origins (2). These mutational signatures are generated from weighing a single mutation from each cancer sample against an aggregated set of cancer mutations from multiple cases of a particular type of cancer. The signature that explains the majority of the somatic mutational processes for the tumor is then reported using a mathematical model. Analyses of the mutational signatures can indicate the damaged component of DNA and which replicative pathways and DNA repair did not function as normal during the development of the disease. Potentially, the mutational signatures can be used to discern active mutational processes from past mutations revealing new anticancer therapy target sites (4).

## Somatic Mutations <a name="3"></a>
Somatic mutations are defined as mutations that occur in any nonâ€“germ cell of the body after conception (5). Types of somatic mutations include single base substitutions; insertions or deletions of small or large segments of DNA; rearrangements, in which DNA breaks and then ligates to a DNA segment from elsewhere in the genome; copy number variations where the number of copies of a specific sequence deviates from the two copies present in the normal diploid genome (6).

Multiple somatic mutational processes contribute to the characteristic mutational signature in cancer genomes (8). In general, somatic mutations come from either exogenous processes (meaning they are caused by environmental factors) or endogenous processes (meaning they are caused by DNA repair mistakes), both of which create distinctive mutational patterns (7). These mutational processes may superimpose on each other in one individual cancer genome (8). Thus, mathematical methods have been developed to systematically characterize each mutational process contributing to a particular type of cancer by deciperhing mutational signatures, estimating the number of mutations that contributes to each signature in a sample, and calculating the probability of each tumor resulting from a particular mutational class signature (8). The presence or absence of mutational signatures may indicate the cellular process occuring or not occuring in the sample (7).
