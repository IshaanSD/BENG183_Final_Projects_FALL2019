## Introduction

Machine learning has become an important topic of discussion in research because it can be used to analyze large datasets and discover specific patterns that are not immediately visible to the human eye. The field of Bioinformatics has increasingly begun to use machine learning methods to gain greater insight and make predictictions about complex biological processes in organisms. Specifically, machine learning methods are being used in genomics to analyze DNA sequences in various ways including finding subclasses of diseases, determining ancestry of individuals, predicting transcription factor binding sites, and predicting cell cycle phases. In discussing machine learning methods, it is important to distinguish two different types of learning: *supervised and unsupervised learning*.

In **supervised learning**, the model is trained using a labeled dataset. In other words, the correct labels are known and act as a “teacher” that corrects the algorithm during its training. The algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training dataset until it reaches an acceptable level of performance. Supervised learning problems can be fall under classification, in which the algorithm's output value is a category.

In **unsupervised learning**, the input data does not have corresponding labels. The goal of this type of learning is to model the distribution of the dataset in order to gain greater insight about the data. Unsupervised learning problems can fall under clustering, which is useful for uncovering groups within the data.
